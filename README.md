# Monty Hall problem simulation
Description of the problem can be seen on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem)

I just don't believe the results in the beginning but the simulation I write forces me to be convinced that to switch your chioce is better:

```bash
$ /usr/bin/python3 monty_hall.py 
Sticky wins 0.33122
Switch wins 0.66878
Done
```

There are too many others who don't believe have written their version of simuation [in this very Github](https://github.com/search?q=monty+hall)
